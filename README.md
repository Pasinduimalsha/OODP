Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OODP.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd OODP
Compile the Java files (requires JDK):
bash
Copy code
javac path/to/PatternExample.java
Usage
Each folder contains code demonstrating a specific design pattern. Open the corresponding Java files in your preferred IDE, compile, and run them to see the pattern in action.

Design Patterns Overview
Abstract Factory Pattern
Directory: AbstractFactory
Description: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
Observer Pattern
Directory: ObserverPattern
Description: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
Singleton Pattern
Directory: SingletonPattern
Description: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
Strategy Design Pattern
Directory: StrategyDesignPattern
Description: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
Template Design Pattern
Directory: TemplateDesignPattern
Description: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure.
Adapter Pattern
Directory: adapter
Description: Converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect, allowing classes to work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
Factory Pattern
Directory: factory_pattern
Description: Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
MVC (Model-View-Controller)
Directory: mvc
Description: Separates an application into three interconnected components (Model, View, Controller), promoting organized code and easier maintenance.
